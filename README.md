Employee Retention Project

Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of HR data, focusing on employee attrition, job satisfaction, and retention. Using key performance indicators (KPIs) and data visualization, Iâ€™ve derived insights to help organizations address high turnover rates and improve employee engagement and satisfaction.

The primary objectives of this Employee retention project were:
To identify factors contributing to high attrition.
To analyze the impact of job roles, departments, and career progression on employee retention.
To offer actionable recommendations for reducing attrition and increasing job satisfaction.

 KPI Requirements:

Key performance indicators (KPIs) developed for this analysis include:

Department-Specific Trends: Sales and Support departments exhibit higher attrition rates (~17%).
Income and Role Correlation: Higher-income roles show lower attrition, while roles like Sales Executive exhibit higher turnover.
Impact of Promotions: Recently promoted employees tend to stay longer, indicating that career progression plays a role in retention.
